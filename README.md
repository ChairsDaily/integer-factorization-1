# Integer-Factorization 
Integer factorization implemented in Python

### Algorithms Used 
  
* Lenstra's Elliptic Curve Factorization   
* Pollard Rho's Algorithm  
* Pollard's p-1 algorithm

These articles were very helpful for the following integer factorization implementation.  
Pollard's p-1 was included in the same.  

### Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/p4r4xor/integer-factorization.git  
cd integer-factorization/  
python factor.py  
```
Running the following prompts you to enter a number of your choice.  
Keyboard Interrupt stops the program.
